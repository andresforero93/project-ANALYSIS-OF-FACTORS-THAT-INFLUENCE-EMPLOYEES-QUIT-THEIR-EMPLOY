# project-ANALYSIS-OF-FACTORS-THAT-INFLUENCE-EMPLOYEES-QUIT-THEIR-EMPLOY
For this project we will work this surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment DETE, and the Technical and Further Education TAFE institue in Queensland, Australia.
Our stakeholders want to know the following:
* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
